# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project ties into my previous WTWR (What to Wear?) as is functioning back-end. It can add, create, and like items posted. As well as create and display userson the site.

I've implemented several new technologies such as a REST API, Server-Side Engineering with Node.js, and a new way to handle errors.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
